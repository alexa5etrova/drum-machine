# Drum-machine
## This is a project for FreecodeCamp certification.

Here via Create-React-App I use following technologies:
 * functional component, which got props from Redux-store via Provider,  and UseEffect Hook to handle keyboard Event
 * Redux (with it I keep data of sounds,  handle state of current sound  and provide Component with data through props)
